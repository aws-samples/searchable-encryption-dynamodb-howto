# Searchable Encryption Demo

[AWS re:Invent 2021 - DynamoDB deep dive: Advanced design patterns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfxBhvGpoa0) presents a database used to run a business, tracking employees, meetings, projects and tickets. He takes six separate tables from an SQL database, and converts them into a single DynamoDB table with three Global Secondary Indexes.

**Question** : Can we do all of these things on an encrypted database
with beacons?

## Record Types

There are six record types in one table.

Attributes tagged with `^` are optional,
as they can be parsed out of the indexed attributes.
Keeping them makes things simpler,
omitting them makes things cheaper.

The `Location` field is a map, for example
`{"City" : "SEA", "Building" : "SEA22", "Floor" : 27, "Desk" : 625}`
or
`{"City" : "SEA", "Building" : "SEA22", "Floor" : 27, "Room" : 625}`

## Changes for Encryption

We will assert that dates and times can be plain text, but all other data needs to be encrypted. If we require encrypting the dates and times then this example becomes untenable, as most queries use date ranges.

### Add Beacons

Each field is encrypted, and so no good for searching; therefore,
we add beacons upon which we can search.

The fields marked with `^` which were optional are now required.
The indexed fields (e.g. PK, SK2) are now beacons,
but have no plaintext form. That is, PK and friends are NOT
configured as fields, encrypted or not.

The only non-index fields used for searching are Duration and Role.
For Duration, the only use is "Duration > 0".
For encryption we will not write the Duration field when it is zero,
and then test for the existence of the encrypted attribute.
`Role` is only matched for equality, so a Standard Beacon will suffice.

Beacons are specifically designed to produce false positives,
so after any search, after the records are decompressed, each
record must be examined to see if it really did match the query, and if
not, that result should be discarded. This is all handled by the ESDK,
but it does impose costs in both seconds and dollars.

### GSI-0

The key schema for the main table has fields that we want to encrypt, but we canâ€™t encrypt primary keys. Thus we create a new index GSI-0, that holds exactly what the unencrypted main index held.
The main table will have no sort key. its partition key will be an HMAC of the (unencrypted) PK and SK fields. Unfortunately, this means that all of the
table's data is replicated in GSI-0, but this cannot be helped.

### Beacon Configuration

This assumes you've read documentation on beacon configuration elsewhere.

All of the index beacons are of necessity Compound Beacons.

All constructor parts are required.
